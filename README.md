# 8 Bit Code

 A bunch of projects for the computers of the **8 bit** era, mostly **MSX 1** and **CoCo 2.**

## [Yayasg!](temp)
**Yet Another Yet Another Snake Game!**
**`MSX` `CoCo`**

It occurred to me the **Snake Games** are the **Hello World!** of game design and I've never done one so I took this opportunity to explore not only the programming of this kind go game, trying for the **fastest speed** I can achieve (while keeping the code **readable**), but also to explore some mythical (to me) characteristics of the computers involved, the "**undocumented**" **graphic modes**.

## [MASCIISDRAWX](temp)
**A Screen 1 drawing program in Assembly**
Screen 1.5[1](temp) coming soon.
**`MSX`** 

I always bragged that I knew **Assembly** but I've never coded anything more than a few small **helper routines** for may **Basic** programs. No more. I decided to make a complete and "useful" program in Assembly to call my own. Also I wanted to explore the undocumented **Screen 1.5** mode on the **MSX** and do something nice with it.

## [Semidraw24](temp)
**A Semigraphics 24 drawing program with a touch of animation**
**`CoCo`**

The **elusive** and criminally underused **Semigraphics** modes on the **CoCo** always fascinated me. I had as given that you needed **Assembly** to access them but when I studied a little more and found out that they were **perfectly accessible** and usable in **Basic** this little exploration program came out.

## [Change Graph Kit](temp)
**Edit game graphics**
**`MSX`**

Back in the olden days I managed to **edit** the **graphics** on **commercial MSX games** by the way of three very small **Basic** programs that could live in memory along them, one at a time, without conflict. They worked but the whole thing was a mess. Recently I decided to know **how far** I could go **remaking** it. It also served as a tool to **test** and **debug** my **[Basic Dignified](temp)** and **[Sublime Tools](temp)** projects.

>**[1]** Screen 1.5 is how I'm calling the Screen 1 hack to color the characters per pattern byte instead of blocks of 8 characters. Here I need to send ANOTHER thank you to [Giovanni Nunes](https://github.com/plainspooky) for pointing me in the right direction.
